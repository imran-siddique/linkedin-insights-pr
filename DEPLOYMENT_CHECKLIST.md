VITE_ENABLE_ANALYTICS=true
VITE_ENABLE_ERROR_REPORTING=true
VITE_MAX_REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE=60
VITE_SCRAPING_RATE_LIMIT=5
VITE_CACHE_TTL=300000
VITE_MAX_CACHE_SIZE=100
```

### Build Commands
```bash
# Clean build

- [x] **Source Maps**: Disabled in production for security
- [x] **Asset Optimization**: Images and assets properly compressed
- [x] **Dependency Audit**: No vulnerable dependencies

## Runtime Monitoring

### Health Check Endpoint
The application includes a built-in health monitoring system that tracks:
- Application uptime and status
- Memory usage and trends
- Cache performance and hit rates
- Error queue status
- Feature flag states

### Key Metrics to Monitor
1. **Application Health**: Overall status (healthy/degraded/unhealthy)
2. **Memory Usage**: Should stay below 70% of available heap
3. **Error Rate**: Should maintain < 1% error rate
4. **Cache Hit Rate**: Should maintain > 80% hit rate for optimal performance
5. **Response Times**: Should stay under 2 seconds for analysis

### Alert Thresholds
- **Critical**: Memory usage > 90%, Error queue > 50 items
- **Warning**: Memory usage > 70%, Error queue > 10 items
- **Info**: Cache hit rate < 60%, Uptime milestones

## Post-Deployment Verification

### Functional Testing
- [ ] **Core Workflow**: LinkedIn profile analysis works end-to-end
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Error states display properly to users
- [ ] **Rate Limiting**: Excessive requests are properly throttled
- [ ] **Caching**: Repeat analyses use cached data appropriately
- [ ] **Responsive Design**: Interface works on mobile and desktop

### Performance Testing
- [ ] **Load Time**: Initial page load < 3 seconds
- [ ] **Analysis Time**: Profile analysis completes < 30 seconds
- [ ] **Memory Stability**: No memory leaks over extended use
- [ ] **Cache Efficiency**: Cache hit rate > 60% after warm-up

### Security Testing
- [ ] **Input Validation**: Invalid inputs are rejected gracefully
- [ ] **XSS Prevention**: No script injection possible
- [ ] **Rate Limiting**: Abuse attempts are blocked
- [ ] **Error Information**: No sensitive data leaked in error messages

## Rollback Plan

### Quick Rollback Steps
1. **Revert Deployment**: Use hosting platform's rollback feature
2. **Clear Cache**: Clear application and CDN caches if needed
3. **Monitor Health**: Verify health checks pass after rollback
4. **User Communication**: Notify users if extended outage occurs

### Recovery Procedures
1. **Data Recovery**: User preferences stored in KV store are persistent
2. **Cache Rebuilding**: Caches will rebuild automatically on first use
3. **Error Monitoring**: Continue monitoring error rates post-recovery

## Maintenance Schedule

### Regular Maintenance
- **Weekly**: Review error logs and performance metrics
- **Monthly**: Update dependencies and security patches
- **Quarterly**: Performance optimization review
- **Annually**: Security audit and penetration testing

### Cache Maintenance
- Automatic cleanup every 5 minutes
- Manual cache clear available through admin interface
- Cache size limits prevent memory overflow

## Success Criteria

### Performance KPIs
- Page load time < 3 seconds (95th percentile)
- Analysis completion < 30 seconds (95th percentile)
- Error rate < 1% of all requests
