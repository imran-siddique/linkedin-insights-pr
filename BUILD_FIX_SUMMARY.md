## Build Errors Fixed

### Summary of Fixes Applied:

1. **Removed @tailwindcss/vite import** from `vite.config.ts`
   - The project uses PostCSS-based Tailwind setup, not the Vite plugin
   - Removed the import line: `import tailwindcss from "@tailwindcss/vite"`
   - Removed the plugin call: `tailwindcss()` from plugins array

2. **Fixed rate limit status type mismatch** in `useLinkedInScraper.ts`
   - Updated the rateLimitStatus state structure to match expected interface
   - Added proper type definitions for rate limiting properties

3. **Recreated corrupted skills-analysis.ts file**
   - The file was completely corrupted with malformed imports and duplicated content
   - Rebuilt the entire file with proper imports and type definitions
   - Ensured all required interfaces are imported from the types file

4. **Verified all dependencies are installed**
   - All shadcn components are present in `/src/components/ui/`
   - All npm packages are properly installed and up to date
   - TypeScript configuration is correct

5. **Confirmed proper file structure**
   - All required files exist and are properly structured
   - Import paths use the correct `@/` alias
   - Global types are properly declared

### Build Configuration Status:
- ✅ Vite configuration uses correct PostCSS-based Tailwind setup
- ✅ TypeScript configuration has proper path aliases
- ✅ All shadcn components are installed and available
- ✅ All imports use correct paths and type definitions
- ✅ Skills analysis service properly recreated
- ✅ React Error Boundary configuration is correct

The main build error (**Cannot find package '@tailwindcss/vite'**) has been resolved by removing the incorrect import and usage of the @tailwindcss/vite plugin from the Vite configuration.

The application now uses the proper PostCSS-based Tailwind CSS setup as configured in `postcss.config.js`.
